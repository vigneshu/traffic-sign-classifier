    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose not to change it to grayscale because I felt the color gives good information for the network to classify the sign. \n",
    "As a first step, I also created more data from the training datasset. The dataset does not have equal images for all classes, but rather skewed towards certain classes. This means that features for classes with less images aren't learn't and the model may be biased with the classes with lots of data. To overcome this, I took the classes with less images and randomly rotated them and added it to the training data again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I normalised the image because it helps speed up learning and gives better results. \n",

Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps.

    "* What was the first architecture that was tried and why was it chosen?\n",
    "THe first architecture was basically the ones provided by the instructors. I felt this would be a good starting point to get started with as LeNet is popularly used and gives good results. \n",
    "* What were some problems with the initial architecture?\n",
    "The main problem was the lack of data for certain classes. To overcome this a few images were rotated and added bacak to improve training. \n",
    "* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? Typical adjustments could include choosing a different model architecture, adding or taking away layers (pooling, dropout, convolution, etc), using an activation function or changing the activation function. One common justification for adjusting an architecture would be due to overfitting or underfitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set indicates over fitting; a low accuracy on both sets indicates under fitting.\n",
    "As mentioned above, Adding a dropout helped improving the training. Dropout prevents overfitting. WIthout the dropout the training gave in good results but the validation accuracy was low. This hinted overfitting and hence I added a dropout layer.\n",
    "* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?\n",
    "I tried out various EPOCH, BATCH size and learning rate. Increasing the EPOCH led to overfitting and therefore I stuck with the parameters given. I did not tune the other parameters also since it gave the required accuracy ayways.\n",
    "* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model?\n",
    "\n",
    "If a well known architecture was chosen:\n",
    "* What architecture was chosen?\n",
    "LeNet architecture was used. \n",
    "* Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application?\n",
    "\n",
    "* How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well?\n",
    " The accuracy was above 93% in the three datasets which suggests the model works well. The model had never seen the validation and test data sets but still produced an excelklent efficiency which suggests a robust model.\n",
